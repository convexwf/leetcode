 * The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at
 * which the corresponding bits are different.
 * 
 * Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 1, y = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * 1   (0 0 0 1)
 * 4   (0 1 0 0)
 * ⁠      ↑   ↑
 * The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are
 * different.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 3, y = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= x, y <= 2^31 - 1
