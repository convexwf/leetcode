 * Testcase Example:  '"anagram"\n"nagaram"'
 *
 * Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false
 * otherwise.
 * 
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
 * different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
 * once.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you
 * adapt your solution to such a case?
