 *
 * Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the
 * mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.
 * 
 * If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.
 * 
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * 
 * 
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal
 * to the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or
 * equal to the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
 * Output: [2]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the
 * implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
