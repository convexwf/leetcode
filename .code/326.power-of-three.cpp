 *
 * Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return
 * false.
 * 
 * An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n
 * == 3^x.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 27
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 27 = 3^3
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 0
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no x where 3^x = 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = -1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no x where 3^x = (-1).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
