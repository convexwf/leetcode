 * Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
 * 
 * 
 * answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
 * answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
 * answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
 * answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
