 * Testcase Example:  '[["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]\n"ABCCED"'
 *
 * Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if
 * word exists in the grid.
 * 
 * The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
 * where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
 * letter cell may not be used more than once.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word
 * = "ABCCED"
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word
 * = "SEE"
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word
 * = "ABCB"
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == board.length
 * n = board[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 6
 * 1 <= word.length <= 15
 * board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a
 * larger board?
