 *
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * 
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is
 * higher or lower than your guess.
 * 
 * You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible
 * results:
 * 
 * 
 * -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
 * 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
 * 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
 * 
 * 
 * Return the number that I picked.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 * Output: 6
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, pick = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, pick = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 * 1 <= pick <= n
