 *
 * Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving
 * of s1 and s2.
 * 
 * An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are
 * divided into n and m non-empty substrings respectively, such that:
 * 
 * 
 * s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
 * t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
 * |n - m| <= 1
 * The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 +
 * t3 + s3 + ...
 * 
 * 
 * Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
 * Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
 * Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" =
 * "aadbbcbcac".
 * Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other
 * string to obtain s3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
 * 0 <= s3.length <= 200
 * s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory
 * space?
