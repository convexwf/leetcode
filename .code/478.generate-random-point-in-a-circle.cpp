 *
 * Given the radius and the position of the center of a circle, implement the
 * function randPoint which generates a uniform random point inside the
 * circle.
 * 
 * Implement the Solution class:
 * 
 * 
 * Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) initializes the
 * object with the radius of the circle radius and the position of the center
 * (x_center, y_center).
 * randPoint() returns a random point inside the circle. A point on the
 * circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle. The answer is
 * returned as an array [x, y].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input
 * ["Solution", "randPoint", "randPoint", "randPoint"]
 * [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [], [], []]
 * Output
 * [null, [-0.02493, -0.38077], [0.82314, 0.38945], [0.36572, 0.17248]]
 * 
 * Explanation
 * Solution solution = new Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
 * solution.randPoint(); // return [-0.02493, -0.38077]
 * solution.randPoint(); // return [0.82314, 0.38945]
 * solution.randPoint(); // return [0.36572, 0.17248]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 < radius <= 10^8
 * -10^7 <= x_center, y_center <= 10^7
 * At most 3 * 10^4 calls will be made to randPoint.
 *
