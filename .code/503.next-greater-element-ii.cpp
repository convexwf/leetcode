 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,1]'
 *
 * Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of
 * nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every
 * element in nums.
 * 
 * The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its
 * traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly
 * to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this
 * number.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1]
 * Output: [2,-1,2]
 * Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
 * The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
 * The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also
 * 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
 * Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
