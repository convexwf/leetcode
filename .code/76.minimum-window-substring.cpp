 * Testcase Example:  '"ADOBECODEBANC"\n"ABC"'
 *
 * Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the
 * minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including
 * duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return
 * the empty string "".
 *
 * The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C'
 * from string t.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "a", t = "a"
 * Output: "a"
 * Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
 * Output: ""
 * Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
 * Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == s.length
 * n == t.length
 * 1 <= m, nÂ <= 10^5
 * s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
