 * Testcase Example:  '[3,2,3]'
 *
 * Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
 * 
 * The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
 * You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
