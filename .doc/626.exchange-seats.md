id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>id</code> <strong>in ascending order</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>
