<p>For simplicity sake, you may assume:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>words.txt</code> contains only lowercase characters and space <code>&#39; &#39;</code> characters.</li>
	<li>Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.</li>
	<li>Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="example">Example:</strong></p>

<p>Assume that <code>words.txt</code> has the following content:</p>

<pre><code>the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is</code></pre>

<p>Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:</p>

<pre><code>the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1</code></pre>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Don&#39;t worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word&#39;s frequency count is unique.</li>
	<li>Could you write it in one-line using <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html">Unix pipes</a>?</li>
</ul>

## Code

```bash
# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
grep -oE '[a-z]+' words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2" "$1}'
```

```bash
# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
tr -s ' ' '\n' < words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'
```

```bash
# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
awk '{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; ++i) ++s[$i];
} END {
    for (i in s) print i, s[i];
}' words.txt | sort -nr -k 2
```
