 * Testcase Example:  '"00110011"'
 *
 * Give a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have
 * the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these
 * substrings are grouped consecutively.
 * 
 * Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they
 * occur.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "00110011"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive
 * 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
 * Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of
 * times they occur.
 * Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are
 * not grouped together.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "10101"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal
 * number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s[i] is either '0' or '1'.

解题思路

1. 动态规划：dp[i] 表示截止到 i 位置且包含 i 位置的有效字符长度，分两种情况讨论。s[i] == s[i-1] 时，就要将 dp[i-1] 视为内字符串，在内字符串的两边加上 s[i] 和 s[i-dp[i-1]-1]，要求这两个字符不能相同；s[i] != s[i-1] 时，就可以直接视作长度为 2 的有效字符串。

        vector<int> dp(s.length(), 0);
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != s[i-1]) {
                dp[i] = 2;
                res += 1;
            }
            else if(i-dp[i-1]-1>=0 && s[i-dp[i-1]-1]!=s[i]) {
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2;
                res += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
